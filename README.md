## DrawCardJS

Using `PHP` drafted for basic structure and backend functions. Then part to part changed to JS version. With several JSON files for settings to control game elements. If use `AngularJS` should write less code for update status variables to frontend.

Remaining PHP files were abandoned. But still can using `generator.php` encrypt **name of json files**. Check another file `handler.js` in js directory.

This game is just prototype. So I haven't tune the game balance. The robot function planned for smoke tests with basic rules.

Finally, I uploaded it on my personal firebase. Enjoy!
